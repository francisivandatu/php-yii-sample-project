				<p>
				Essex Funding, Inc. is a nationwide provider of equipment financing for growing businesses. Essex offers simple equipment lease options, superior customer service, and flexible credit underwriting.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The firm was founded by the principals of Essex Capital Group, a corporate finance firm that has arranged over $550 million in debt financing for small and mid-market companies across the United States since 2003. In working with scores of entrepreneurs to recapitalize their balance sheets, the founders recognized that many clients involved in manufacturing or distributing equipment were completely dependent on their customers’ credit availability to make purchases.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Essex Funding has developed a financing solution that solves this issue for companies in our vendor financing program. Instead of sales opportunities lost due to a customer lacking available credit, these equipment companies now have a 100% financing solution to offer their clients. A simplified, one page application and virtually overnight approval allows their customers to buy product with no cash out of pocket.  
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Essex’s customized lease structures can be used to purchase new or used equipment. Our management team’s broad financing expertise and large network of capital providers allow us to provide a full range of financing solutions for equipment acquisitions in a variety of industries, including vending, healthcare, construction, technology, and hospitality.
