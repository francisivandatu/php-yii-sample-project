				<p>If you are a vending operator interested in updating your equipment, but you can't afford the initial cash outlay, call Essex. The vending machine market is expected to expand dramatically into Micro Markets according to industry sources, with 35,000+ units expected in service over the next decade.</p>
				<p>As a result of greater demand for health food and organic products, many vending companies are now focusing on healthier options. New health food vending machines now come with LCD screens with streaming video graphics and credit card options. They are also more energy efficient than traditional vending machines. </p>
