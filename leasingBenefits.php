					<li>Generally requires no restrictive covenants or financial reporting.</li>
				</ul>

			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p><strong>Loan</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Usually requires down payment of 20% or more of purchase price.</li>
					<li>Typically won't include soft costs such as shipping, training, and installation. </li>
					<li>Assets held as owned equipment with corresponding liability.</li>
					<li>Tax deduction for the interest and depreciation portion of the loan payment may be utilized, but this amount is less advantageous than expensing the entire payment amount.</li>
					<li>Borrower takes risk of equipment devaluation with technological obsolescence.</li>
					<li>Often requires additional collateral than just the equipment being purchased. </li>
					<li>Rates are often floating, subjecting the borrower to take risk that their payments could rise. </li>
					<li>Often requires borrower to maintain certain financial ratios and report financials monthly. </li>
